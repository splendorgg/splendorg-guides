# Overview
This project is a user authentication system developed with a Go backend and Svelte frontend, using modern tools and libraries for a seamless and efficient user experience. The application allows users to sign up, log in, and access protected routes through JWT-based authentication. The frontend is built with Svelte, a fast and lightweight framework that ensures smooth interactions and minimal overhead. The backend is developed using Go, known for its performance and scalability, providing a secure API for user authentication and management.

# How It Works
This diagram represents the flow of a request from the frontend to the backend in a typical user authentication process. It outlines the sequence of steps taken by the backend to process the request, validate the user data, interact with the database, and return a response containing a JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication.

| Backend Router                |
|  - The request is routed to   |
|    the appropriate controller |

               |
               v

| Controller (Signup/Login)     |
|  - The request is processed,  |

| Data Validation and Processing|
|  - Email and password are     |
|    validated, password is     |
|    hashed                     |
+-------------------------------+
               |
               v
+-------------------------------+
| Database Operations           |
|  - User is created in the     |
|    database                   |
|  - User is queried for login  |
+-------------------------------+
               |
               v
+-------------------------------+
| Token Generation (JWT)        |
|  - JWT token is created using |
|    user data                  |
+-------------------------------+
               |
               v
+-------------------------------+
| Response to Frontend          |
|  - Token is sent back in the  |
